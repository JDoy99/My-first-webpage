# My-first-webpage
My first webpage made from basic HTML + CSS


I have been learning HTML + CSS at home for the past week or so now and decided to use the knowledge which I have gained
to make a very basic webpage to show my understanding. Over time I shall work on new parts to make it stand out more and
add extra information. I hope you like it.
